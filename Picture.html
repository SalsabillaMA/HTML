  The energy crisis triggered by the increase in world oil prices has also crushed the lives of various layers
of society in Indonesia, because the level of demand for fuel oil continues to increase, therefore
alternative energy is needed to replace BBM, so that the chain of life on this earth can run well. Many
non-BBM alternative energy can be developed, one of which is biogas. The utilization of biogas energy
 sources has begun to be developed at the Swadaya Pandan Mulyo Agriculture and Rural Training Center
 but the production capacity of the existing system is still not optimal, this is because the existing
equipment is still manual and simple so extra energy is needed in order to continue producing biogas.
 Seeing these problems we made technological innovations needed to overcome this problem, namely
with BIOTHINGS V2 as the development of an automatic biogas mixer based on IoT (Internet of Things).
BIOTHINGS V2 is an automatic biogas mixer that uses an electric motor as the main driving system.
The electric motor will move automatically when cow dung is inserted into the mixing place that has
been installed ultrasonic sensors. In general, BIOTHINGS load sensors as inputs, processors by
microcontrollers, and outputs in graphical use r interfaces through the web, and Android smartphones
 so that monitoring and making biogas becomes more effective.
